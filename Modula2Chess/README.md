Original description:

Another chess game this time written in Modula2. This is an example of how you can use the Modula2 language to write more interesting programs than "hello world".

This Modula2 program is hence a nice demo for testing the Modula2Java17 Modula2 to Java compiler.
The repository contains both the original, unmodified Modula2 sources in `src` and the Java code generated by Modula2Java17 in `java`.
