> Another chess game this time written in Modula-2. This is an example of how you can use the Modula-2 language to write more interesting programs than "hello world".

This Modula-2 program is hence a nice demo for testing the Modula2Java17 Modula-2 to Java compiler.
The repository contains both the original, unmodified Modula-2 sources in `src` and the Java code generated by Modula2Java17 in `java`.
